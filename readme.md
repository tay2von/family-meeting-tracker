The reason I designed this program is to make a tracking tool for facilitators to track each of their family meetings. 

After the facilitator completes their first meeting, they are required to complete several other meetings on the same case within specific timeframes. 

This program is designed to track each meeting the facilitator has and notify the faciltator when they have a meeting coming due. 

This program is designed with security features due to the confidentialilty of these meetings. 

Only the facilitator can see his/her meetings. 

Once you create a meeting. The system will automatically log it and notify you how many days you have until the next meeting is due. 

Once you log in. You will also receive an alert if you have a meeting coming due within 10 days. 

Right now this program is just to track meetings. Once I get the program completed. I will add more features as they see fit. 

This program is designed by Tayvon Lewis for OKDHS
